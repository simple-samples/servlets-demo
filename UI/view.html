    our API call function - needs to be async/await. Async tells the interpreter that this function
    may need to await a promise. Async does nothing without await, and vice versa. Await says that
    the following function call may not return imedately. The event scheduler will ocasionally poll
    the promise to see if it is fulfilled or rejected. The interpreter will execute other code outside
    the async function while it waits. Code inside this function will not be executed until the
    promise resolves.

<!-- 
    Down here we have the form. The action attribute is the location where the data should be sent.
    The method attribute tells the browser what sort of HTTP request to make, and the target attribute 
    tells the browser where to navigate to when the request is complete. 

    In this case we are POSTing our form data to the /login endpoint and telling the browser not to
    redirect us by saying the redirection target is "_blank"

    Our form also has labels. It's important to consider how the user will interact with the client. 
    We use the labels to direct the user to input valid info.

    Lastly we have two buttons at the bottom. These are nested within the same <form> tag as the other
    elements and will act on this form. Submit will transmit our data to the endpoint, and reset will clear
    the input fields.
